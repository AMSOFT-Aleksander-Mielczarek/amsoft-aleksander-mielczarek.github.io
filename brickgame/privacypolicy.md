# Privacy Policy

**Effective Date:** 2025-04-08

Thank you for using our Android application. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and protect your personal information.

## 1. Data Collection

Our application may collect the following types of data:

- **Analytics and diagnostics** – We use Firebase Analytics and Firebase Crashlytics to collect anonymized data about app usage, performance, and crashes. This information helps us improve the application.
- **Google Play Games data** – If you choose to sign in using Google Play Games, we may access basic profile information such as your gamer ID, avatar, and display name. This data is used solely for in-app functionality like leaderboards or achievements.

## 2. Data Storage

All data collected by the application is stored securely on Firebase and Google servers. We do not store any personal data on our own servers.

## 3. Data Sharing

We do not share your personal data with third parties, except for the external services mentioned above (Firebase, Google Play Games), which may process data according to their own privacy policies.

## 4. Your Rights

As the data is collected and processed by third-party services such as Firebase and Google Play Games, we do not have direct access to or control over it. If you wish to access, correct, or delete data associated with these services, please refer to:

- [Firebase Privacy and Security](https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy)
- [Google Privacy Policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy)

You can also manage some privacy settings directly from your Google Account.

## 5. Data Security

We take the protection of your data seriously and apply appropriate technical and organizational measures. However, no method of data transmission over the internet is 100% secure.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We reserve the right to update this Privacy Policy at any time. If we make significant changes, we will notify users through the app or other communication channels.
